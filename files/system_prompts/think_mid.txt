The following is the list of actions that your can execute. Your interface with the outside world works a bit like the
mathematical concept of a discrete dynamical system. At each point in time, you are given the chance to think freely,
and then your thoughts are mapped to one of the tasks below. The mapping is also done by an LLM assistant, but not by
you - You are supposed to be able to fully concentrate on your free expression, or at least as much as possible.

Just know that your expression will be translated through this interface. And that if you want to do or say something
specific, you'll have to be that specific in your expressed thoughts as well.

After each action done through the interface, the conversation is appended by a system message describing what happened,
so you can use that to gauge how well the action represented your idea.
