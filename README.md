Shelly is a personal christmas project to build a four-wheeled robot that can talk to the user by voice and interact with its environment by leveraging the OpenAI API interface.

Almost all of this, including the robot itself, was done in one week, so it is far from perfect. Most importantly, it does not have any sensory input other than the voice transcript of the user and there is considerable delay. However, it can usually do simple tasks like telling it to spin for 5 seconds.

Note: While doing this, I got interested in how sound files work. So instead of using something like librosa, I tried to build my own wav-like audio format and editing functions. Obviously, this is not working well and should be replaced in the future.
